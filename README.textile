h1. jQuery stuff

h4. A grabbag of plugins I've written over the years

This is a humble repository of jQuery plugins that I've written for our projects. These are usually small plugins (<75 sloc).

If you're to use any of these, I encourage you to just drop it into your project and maintain it yourself--I can't claim maintain these in a backward-compatible manner.

These plugins make great 'starting points' for whatever you'll need. Take them and modify them (or not) as you see fit.

h3. Super-useful

These things are often basic features that most sites/webapps I work on need.
